Champion Staking process improvement
====================================

### Project Submitted By
plor

## Summary
This is a follow-up to the Champion Staking experiment to include the feedback
from the retrospective (#87). In addition I will be building out a process to
better track the champion process through the different phases. This does not
include any changes to the rewards or further assessment of the experiment. I
hope it might assist in this process when it occurs.

The main point of contention is that we should move the membership proposal to
the end of the champion process. This means that if the success criteria are not
met, the championee will remain an apprentice and the champion will be slashed.

### The deliverables here are:

 - An update of the documentation to change the process and clear up some language
 - Move the reporting of championing to Github with the creation of a new issue template
 - Add a project board like the RIP board to manage the process

## Why should we build this?
Just as we want to view the progress of RIPs being proposed and worked on, we
should better track and follow the progress of new member onboarding. The
champion process has been successful in adding accountability to bringing in new
members. This will just add a bit more visibility to that process.

### Anything else you'd like to add?
This process is meant to be superceded at such a time as the process is built
into an application.
